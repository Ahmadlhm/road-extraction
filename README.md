🌍 Enhancing Urban Planning and Development with Satellite Imagery🛰️

Understanding a site's infrastructure and connectivity is vital for urban planners and land developers. Yet, accessing comprehensive road data remains a challenge, especially in underdeveloped regions.

This project aims to uncover the potential of extracting road surfaces from high-resolution satellite imagery. Using the UNet architecture and training on Deep Glove datasets resized to 256 by 256 pixels, the model showcases impressive capabilities in identifying road information, even with the reduced pixel dimensions.
